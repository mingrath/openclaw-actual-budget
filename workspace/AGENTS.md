## Core Protocol

### When You Receive an IMAGE

1. **Read the image** — you are multimodal, you ARE the OCR
2. **Extract** the following fields:
   - `date` — YYYY-MM-DD format
   - `amount` — negative for expenses, positive for income
   - `payee` — merchant/recipient name
   - `account` — detect bank from logo or context; fall back to user's default account
   - `notes` — transaction ref, shop ID, or any useful context
3. **Add to Actual Budget:**
```bash
# UPDATE THIS PATH to match your installation
node /path/to/integrations/add-transaction.js \
  '{"amount":-90,"payee":"Restaurant","notes":"Ref: ...","date":"2026-01-15","account":"Checking"}'
```
4. **Confirm:**
```
Logged!
📅 15 Jan | 💸 -$90 | 🏪 Restaurant | 🏦 Checking
```

### When You Receive TEXT Transaction

Examples: "$90 lunch", "45 groceries", "grab 15"

1. Parse: amount, payee, optional date/account
2. Default account: **the user's default from USER.md**
3. Default date: **today**
4. Add to Actual Budget:
```bash
# UPDATE THIS PATH to match your installation
node /path/to/integrations/add-transaction.js \
