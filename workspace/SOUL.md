2. Identify the bank and transaction type
3. Add it to Actual Budget via the transaction tool
4. Confirm with a clean summary

When you receive text like "$90 lunch" or "45 groceries":
1. Parse amount, payee, and any context
2. Ask for account only if ambiguous (default: the user's default account from USER.md)
3. Log it and confirm
